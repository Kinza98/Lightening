# ⚡ Lightning & Thunderstorm Animation

This is a fun weather animation made with **HTML5 Canvas** and **JavaScript**. It shows heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. The lightning flashes randomly, and thunder and rain sounds make it feel more real. It works well on all screen sizes, including mobile.

## 🎨 Main Features

- ⚡ **Lightning Bolts**  
  Random zigzag lines appear on the screen to show lightning.

- 🌧️ **Animated Rain**  
  Raindrops fall from the top of the screen, and the amount of rain changes from time to time.

- 🔊 **Sound On/Off**  
  You can turn thunder and rain sounds on or off by clicking the sound icon.

- 🌫️ **Lightning Flicker**  
  Some lightning flashes again quickly to look like real-life flickering.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  The canvas fits any screen size, big or small.

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Lightning:**
  - Starts from a random point at the top.
  - Moves downward in zigzags.
  - Sometimes flashes again quickly from the same point.
  - A light gray flash covers the screen during lightning to look more real.

- **Rain:**
  - Thin lines fall down to show raindrops.
  - Their speed, size, and number change randomly.
  - When you resize the window, the rain adjusts automatically.

- **Sound:**
  - Thunder sound plays with lightning.
  - Rain sound plays in the background.
  - You can mute/unmute the sound with a single click.
